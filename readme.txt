== Description ==

With [Iceberg](https://useiceberg.com/), you get what you need to write beautifully in [WordPress](https://wordpress.org), along with many delightful extras you’d never expect. Your next favorite writing application just may be WordPress + Iceberg. Iceberg allows you to write within the WordPress block editor in a way that feels much more natural than working with “blocks”. Our goal is not to remove blocks, but rather to deemphasize them – and any non-essential elements within the editor – to promote a focus on writing.
